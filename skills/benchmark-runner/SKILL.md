description: >
  Designs structured benchmarks for comparing algorithms, models, or implementations.
  Selects appropriate metrics (latency, throughput, memory, accuracy), designs representative
  test cases, captures hardware/software context, produces comparison tables with tradeoff
  analysis, and includes reproduction instructions.
  Triggers on: "benchmark", "compare performance", "which is faster", "latency comparison",
  "memory comparison", "run benchmark", "design benchmark", "compare implementations",
  "evaluate algorithms", "performance comparison", "throughput test", "speed test".
  Use this skill when comparing two or more implementations, algorithms, or models.

# Benchmark Runner

Standardizes performance comparison methodology: metric selection, test case design,
environment capture, result formatting, and tradeoff analysis. Produces reproducible
benchmark reports that support informed decisions — not just "A is faster than B" but
"A is faster for small inputs while B scales better."

## Prerequisites

- Clear candidates to compare (at least 2)
- Access to run or observe the candidates (code, API, or existing results)
- Representative workload definition

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Define Scope

1. **What are the candidates?** — Name each candidate precisely, including version.
   "Python dict vs Redis" is too vague. "Python 3.12 dict (in-process) vs Redis 7.2
   (localhost, TCP)" is testable.
2. **What claims need validation?** — "A is faster" → faster at what? For what input
   size? Under what load? Benchmark design flows from the specific claim.
3. **What is the decision context?** — Why does this comparison matter? This determines
   which metrics are most important.

### Phase 2: Select Metrics

Choose metrics that match the decision context:

| Metric Category | Specific Metrics                        | When Important                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Latency         | P50, P95, P99, mean, std dev            | User-facing operations, API calls            |
| Throughput      | ops/sec, tokens/sec, MB/sec             | Batch processing, streaming                  |
| Memory          | Peak RSS, avg RSS, allocation rate      | Resource-constrained environments            |
| Accuracy        | F1, BLEU, exact match, precision/recall | ML models, algorithms with quality tradeoffs |
| Cost            | $/1K operations, $/hour, $/GB           | Cloud services, API comparisons              |
| Startup         | Time to first operation, cold start     | Serverless, CLI tools                        |

Select 2-4 metrics. More than 4 makes comparison tables unreadable.

### Phase 3: Design Test Cases

Create a matrix of inputs that reveal performance characteristics:

1. **Scale variation** — Small, medium, large inputs. Performance often changes
   non-linearly with scale.
2. **Representative data** — Use realistic inputs, not synthetic best-case data.
3. **Edge cases** — Empty input, maximum size, adversarial input.
4. **Warmup** — Exclude JIT compilation, cache warming, and connection establishment
   from measurements. Run N warmup iterations before recording.

### Phase 4: Specify Environment

Record everything needed to reproduce the results:

1. **Hardware** — CPU model, core count, RAM size, GPU model (if applicable)
2. **Software** — OS version, language runtime version, dependency versions
3. **Configuration** — Thread count, batch size, connection pool size, cache settings
4. **Isolation** — What else was running? Background processes affect results.

### Phase 5: Structure Results

Produce comparison tables with clear winners per metric, followed by tradeoff analysis.

## Configuring Scope

| Mode | Candidates | Depth | When to Use |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `quick` | 2 candidates, 1-2 metrics | Single test case, no statistics | Rough comparison, sanity check |
| `standard` | 2-3 candidates, 2-4 metrics | 3 test cases, mean + std dev | Default for most comparisons |
| `rigorous` | Any count, full metric suite | Multiple test cases, percentiles, significance tests | Publication, critical decisions |

## Calibration Rules

1. **Measure, don't guess.** Intuition about performance is unreliable. "Obviously
   faster" is not a benchmark result.
2. **Apples to apples.** Candidates must be compared under identical conditions.
   Different hardware, configuration, or input data invalidates the comparison.
3. **Report variance, not just means.** A mean of 50ms with std dev of 100ms is not
   the same as a mean of 50ms with std dev of 2ms. Always report spread.
4. **Warm up before measuring.** First-run performance includes JIT, cache warming,
   and connection setup. Exclude warmup iterations from results.
5. **Representative inputs only.** Benchmarking with synthetic best-case input is
   misleading. Use data that resembles production workloads.
6. **State the winner per metric, not overall.** "A is better" is lazy. "A has lower
   latency; B uses less memory" is useful.

## Error Handling

| Problem | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| Cannot run candidates locally | Design the benchmark specification. Document what to measure and how. The user executes separately. |
| Results are noisy (high variance) | Increase iteration count. Check for background processes. Use dedicated hardware or containers for isolation. |
| Candidates serve different purposes | Acknowledge that the comparison is partial. Benchmark only the overlapping functionality. |
| No baseline exists | Establish one candidate as the baseline. Report relative performance (e.g., "B is 1.3x faster than A"). |
| Hardware context unavailable | Document what is known. Note that results may not be reproducible without full context. |

## When NOT to Benchmark

Push back if:
- The comparison is not performance-related (feature comparison → use a decision matrix or ADR instead)
- The candidates are fundamentally different tools (comparing a database to a message queue)
- The user wants to benchmark trivial operations (comparing two string concatenation methods in Python)
- Results from others already exist and conditions match — link to existing benchmarks instead
