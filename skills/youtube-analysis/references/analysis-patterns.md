# Analysis Patterns by Video Type

Reference document for structuring transcript analysis based on video format.
Claude reads this to calibrate extraction strategy per video type.

## Lecture

**Focus areas:** Core thesis, supporting arguments, cited works, key definitions, logical flow

**What to extract:**
- Central thesis or claim (state in one sentence)
- Supporting arguments with evidence cited

- References to papers, books, researchers, or prior work
- Counterarguments the speaker addresses

**What to skip:** Housekeeping remarks, repeated summaries, audience Q&A tangents

**Output structure:**
```
## TL;DR
[One-sentence thesis]

## Key Concepts
- **[Term]**: [Definition as presented]
- ...

## Detailed Analysis
### Thesis
### Supporting Arguments
### Counterarguments Addressed
### Cited Works

## Notable Quotes / Statements
- "[Quote]" — on [topic] ([timestamp])

## Actionable Takeaways
[What the audience should do or investigate next]
```

## Tutorial

**Focus areas:** Steps, tools/technologies, prerequisites, gotchas, versions

**What to extract:**
- Prerequisites (tools, accounts, prior knowledge)
- Exact steps in order, with commands/code when spoken
- Tools and their versions mentioned
- Common pitfalls the presenter warns about
- Alternatives mentioned but not chosen (and why)
- Final result or expected output

**What to skip:** Setup troubleshooting for specific OSes (unless the tutorial is OS-specific), sponsor segments

**Output structure:**
```
## TL;DR
[What you'll build/achieve]

## Key Concepts
- **Prerequisites**: [list]
- **Stack**: [tools and versions]

## Detailed Analysis
### Step 1: [Action] ([timestamp])
### Step 2: [Action] ([timestamp])
...

## Notable Quotes / Statements
- Warnings or gotchas the presenter emphasizes

## Technical Terms & Definitions
[Terms introduced during the tutorial]

## Actionable Takeaways
- Step-by-step checklist to reproduce
```

## Interview

**Focus areas:** Key perspectives, disagreements, unique insights, background context

**What to extract:**
- Each speaker's core positions (attributed)
- Points of agreement and disagreement
- Anecdotes or examples that illustrate key points
- Paraphrased notable statements (with timestamps)
- Background context the interviewer provides
- Recommendations (books, tools, practices) each person makes

**What to skip:** Small talk, repeated questions, filler conversation

**Output structure:**
```
## TL;DR
[Core topic and main takeaway]

## Key Concepts
- **[Speaker A]'s position**: [summary]
- **[Speaker B]'s position**: [summary]

## Detailed Analysis
### Topic 1: [Theme]
- [Speaker A]: [position]
- [Speaker B]: [position]
### Topic 2: [Theme]
...

## Notable Quotes / Statements
- "[Paraphrased quote]" — [Speaker], on [topic] ([timestamp])

## Actionable Takeaways
[Synthesized advice from all speakers]
```

## Podcast

**Focus areas:** Topics covered, opinions, recommendations, tangents worth noting

**What to extract:**
- Topic thread progression (what was discussed, in what order)
- Opinions expressed (attributed to speaker)
- Recommendations: books, tools, services, people, content
- Anecdotes that illustrate points
- Running jokes or references (for context)
- Disagreements between hosts/guests

**What to skip:** Ad reads, repeated self-promotion, extensive inside jokes without substance

**Output structure:**
```
## TL;DR
[Main topics and one key insight]

## Key Concepts
### Topic Thread: [Theme 1]
### Topic Thread: [Theme 2]
...

## Detailed Analysis
[Topic-by-topic breakdown with speaker attributions]

## Notable Quotes / Statements
[Memorable or insightful statements]

## Actionable Takeaways
- Recommendations mentioned:
  - Books: [list]
  - Tools: [list]
  - People to follow: [list]
```

## Tech Talk

**Focus areas:** Architecture decisions, trade-offs, benchmarks, lessons learned, production experience

**What to extract:**
- Problem statement and constraints
- Architecture or system design described
- Trade-offs explicitly discussed (chose X over Y because Z)
- Performance numbers, benchmarks, scale metrics
- Lessons learned from production
- Technologies and versions mentioned
- What they'd do differently

**What to skip:** Company recruiting pitches, overly basic background for the audience level

**Output structure:**
```
## TL;DR
[Problem solved and approach taken]

## Key Concepts
- **Problem**: [statement]
- **Solution**: [approach]
- **Scale**: [numbers if mentioned]

## Detailed Analysis
### Problem & Constraints
### Architecture / Design
### Trade-offs
| Decision | Chose | Over | Rationale |
|----------|-------|------|-----------|
### Performance / Results
### Lessons Learned

## Technical Terms & Definitions
[Domain-specific terms defined in context]

## Actionable Takeaways
[What to apply in your own systems]
```

---

## Panel

**Focus areas:** Consensus vs. disagreement, unique perspectives per speaker, emerging themes

**What to extract:**
- Each panelist's background (as introduced)
- Consensus points (what everyone agrees on)
- Disagreement points (attributed positions)
- Unique perspectives only one panelist holds
- Moderator's framing questions
- Audience questions that shifted discussion

**What to skip:** Introductions beyond establishing expertise, repeated moderator summaries

**Output structure:**
```
## TL;DR
[Panel topic and the one thing that emerged]

...

## Detailed Analysis
### Theme 1: [Topic]
- **Consensus**: [what all agree on]
- **[Panelist A]**: [unique angle]

### Theme 2: [Topic]
...

## Notable Quotes / Statements
- "[Quote]" — [Speaker] ([timestamp])

## Actionable Takeaways
[Synthesized wisdom across all panelists]
```

## Auto-Detection Heuristics

When `--type auto`, Claude should infer the video type from:

| Signal | Likely Type |
|--------|-------------|
| Single speaker, academic tone, citations | Lecture |
| "Let me show you how to..." / screen share references | Tutorial |
| Two speakers, question-answer pattern | Interview |
| Casual conversation, multiple topics, recurring hosts | Podcast |
| Conference stage, system/architecture focus | Tech Talk |
| 3+ speakers, moderator, topic rotation | Panel |

If uncertain, default to a generic analysis that pulls from all patterns.
