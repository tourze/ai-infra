Effort estimation heuristics for task sizing during decomposition.

## T-Shirt Sizes

| Size             | Duration    | Lines of Code | Complexity                          |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| S (Small)        | < 4 hours   | < 100         | Single function, clear requirements |
| M (Medium)       | 4-16 hours  | 100-500       | Multiple functions, some decisions  |
| L (Large)        | 16-40 hours | 500-2000      | Multiple files, design decisions    |
| XL (Extra Large) | > 40 hours  | > 2000        | MUST decompose further              |

## Complexity Indicators

### Factors That Increase Size

| Factor                   | Impact     | Example                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| New technology           | +1 size    | First time using WebSockets     |
| External API integration | +1 size    | Third-party payment API         |
| Data migration           | +1 size    | Transforming existing data      |
| Security requirements    | +1 size    | Auth, encryption, audit logging |
| Backward compatibility   | +1 size    | Must support old and new format |
| Multiple edge cases      | +1 size    | Complex validation rules        |
| Concurrency              | +1-2 sizes | Race conditions, locks          |

### Factors That Decrease Size

| Factor                     | Impact  | Example                              |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Existing pattern           | -1 size | CRUD endpoint matching existing ones |
| Library handles complexity | -1 size | Using ORM instead of raw SQL         |
| Clear specification        | -1 size | Detailed requirements with examples  |
| Team familiarity           | -1 size | Done something similar recently      |

## Reference Tasks

Use known-complexity tasks as anchors:

| Reference Task                        | Typical Size |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Add a new field to an existing model  | S            |
| New CRUD endpoint (standard pattern)  | M            |
| New API endpoint with business logic  | M-L          |
| Database migration with data backfill | M-L          |
| Third-party API integration           | L            |
| Authentication system                 | L-XL         |
| Search functionality                  | L            |
| File upload with validation           | M            |
| Email notification system             | M-L          |
| Caching layer                         | M            |
| Rate limiting                         | M            |
| Pagination                            | S-M          |

## Estimation Biases

### Planning Fallacy

People consistently underestimate by 25-50%. Counteract by:

- Comparing to similar past tasks (reference class forecasting)
- Using three-point estimation (best/likely/worst)
- Adding buffer for unknowns (20% minimum)

### Anchoring

First estimate heard becomes the anchor. Counteract by:

- Estimate independently before discussing
- Use bottom-up (task-level) estimation, not top-down

### Optimism Bias

"It'll be straightforward" → it rarely is. Counteract by:

- List specific unknowns for each task
- Ask: "What could go wrong?"
- Check: "What took longer than expected last time?"

## From Size to Duration

### Solo Developer

| Size | Calendar Days | Working Hours |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------- |
| S    | 0.5-1         | 2-4           |
| M    | 1-2           | 4-16          |
| L    | 2-5           | 16-40         |

### Team (with review/communication overhead)

| Size | Calendar Days | Notes                         |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| S    | 1             | Including code review         |
| M    | 2-3           | Including review and revision |
| L    | 3-5           | Including design discussion   |

Add 20% for context switching if working on multiple tasks.
