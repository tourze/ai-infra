# Unknown Categories

Types of unknowns that affect estimates, with identification techniques and mitigation strategies.

## Technical Unknowns

Things we don't know how to do or whether they'll work.

| Unknown                | Impact                                       | Mitigation                                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| New technology         | Learning curve, unexpected limitations       | Spike: prototype for 1-2 days first        |
| Performance at scale   | Code works but may be slow                   | Define threshold, build benchmark early    |
| Integration complexity | Third-party API may not behave as documented | Test integration earliest possible         |
| Data quality           | Input data may be messier than expected      | Sample and analyze data before estimating  |
| Algorithm suitability  | Chosen approach may not work                 | Prototype with real data before committing |

### Detection Questions

- "Have we used this technology before?"
- "Does this depend on undocumented behavior?"
- "Are we making assumptions about data quality?"
- "Will this work at production scale?"

## Scope Unknowns

Things that may change what we're building.

| Unknown                       | Impact                                        | Mitigation                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Requirements may change       | Rework, wasted effort                         | Implement core first, defer details             |
| Edge cases not yet identified | Additional work discovered mid-implementation | Edge case brainstorm session upfront            |
| Design not finalized          | UI/UX changes after implementation starts     | Get design approval before starting             |
| Acceptance criteria unclear   | "Done" is ambiguous                           | Define testable criteria before starting        |
| Feature creep                 | Scope grows during implementation             | Freeze scope, defer additions to next iteration |

### Detection Questions

- "Is the specification complete?"
- "Have all stakeholders agreed on the scope?"
- "What would the user say if we showed them this spec?"
- "What's explicitly out of scope?"

## External Unknowns

Things outside our control.

| Unknown                     | Impact                                      | Mitigation                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| External API availability   | Blocked if API is down or access delayed    | Request access early, mock while waiting |
| Dependency release          | Waiting for a library fix/feature           | Use workaround, contribute fix upstream  |
| Third-party approval        | Waiting for partner/vendor action           | Start early, have alternative plan       |
| Infrastructure provisioning | Waiting for servers, databases, permissions | Request infrastructure in Phase 1        |
| Legal/compliance review     | Waiting for approval                        | Submit for review as early as possible   |

### Detection Questions

- "Does this depend on anyone outside the team?"
- "Are we waiting for any external input?"
- "What happens if the external dependency is delayed by 2 weeks?"

## Integration Unknowns

Things that emerge when components connect.

| Unknown                 | Impact                                 | Mitigation                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Interface mismatch      | Components don't connect as expected   | Define interfaces in Foundation phase   |
| Data format differences | Serialization/deserialization issues   | Test integration points early           |
| Performance interaction | Components fast alone, slow together   | Integration test with realistic data    |
| Error propagation       | Error in A causes cascade through B, C | Design error handling across boundaries |
| State management        | Shared state between components        | Define state ownership early            |

### Detection Questions

- "Where do components communicate?"
- "Have we tested the interfaces between components?"
- "What happens when one component fails?"

## Organizational Unknowns

Things about people and process.

| Unknown           | Impact                                                   | Mitigation                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Team availability | Key person on vacation, sick, pulled to another project  | Identify backup, document everything          |
| Review bottleneck | Code review takes days, not hours                        | Set review SLA, pair program instead          |
| Decision delay    | Architecture decision needed, no one available to decide | Identify decisions upfront, escalate early    |
| Knowledge gap     | Only one person understands the system                   | Pair sessions, documentation                  |
| Priority shift    | Project deprioritized mid-sprint                         | Accept risk, plan for minimum viable delivery |

## Unknown Impact Matrix

| Category       | Typical Impact on Worst Case | Frequency           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Technical      | 2-5x the likely estimate     | Common              |
| Scope          | 1.5-3x                       | Common              |
| External       | 0 or complete block          | Uncommon but severe |
| Integration    | 1.5-2x                       | Common              |
| Organizational | 1.2-2x                       | Moderate            |

## When Unknowns Dominate

If unknowns dominate the estimate (worst case > 3x best case):

1. **Spike first** — Invest 1-2 days investigating the biggest unknown
2. **Re-estimate after spike** — New information narrows the range
3. **Timebox** — If you can't reduce uncertainty, timebox: "We'll work on this for 5 days and see where we are"
4. **Accept uncertainty** — Communicate the wide range honestly rather than pretending certainty
