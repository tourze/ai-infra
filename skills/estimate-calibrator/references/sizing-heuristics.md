## Quick Sizing Rules

### The "Lines of Integration" Heuristic

Count the number of external integration points:

| Integration Points  | Typical Size |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| 0 (pure logic)      | S-M          |
| 1 (one API, one DB) | M            |
| 2-3                 | M-L          |
| 4+                  | L-XL         |

Each integration adds:

- Error handling
- Retry logic
- Configuration
- Testing with mocks

### The "Decision Count" Heuristic

Count the number of design decisions required:

| Decisions                   | Typical Size |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| 0 (follow existing pattern) | S            |
| 1-2 (minor choices)         | M            |
| 3-5 (architectural choices) | L            |
| 5+ (many unknowns)          | XL           |

### The "File Count" Heuristic

Count the number of files that need to change:

| Files | Typical Size                     |
| ----- | -------------------------------- |
| 1-2   | S                                |
| 3-5   | M                                |
| 5-10  | L                                |
| 10+   | XL (or should be multiple tasks) |

## Effort Multipliers

Apply these to the base estimate:

| Factor                         | Multiplier | When                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| First time with technology     | 2.0x       | Never used this library/framework     |
| Second time                    | 1.3x       | Used once before                      |
| Third+ time                    | 1.0x       | Familiar pattern                      |
| Security-sensitive             | 1.5x       | Auth, crypto, PII handling            |
| Cross-team coordination        | 1.3x       | Need input/approval from another team |
| Legacy codebase                | 1.3-2.0x   | Poor documentation, no tests          |
| High test coverage requirement | 1.3x       | 90%+ coverage target                  |
| Accessibility requirements     | 1.2x       | WCAG compliance                       |

## "Should I Estimate or Spike?"

| Condition                            | Action                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Less than 2 unknowns, familiar stack | Estimate directly                     |
| 2-3 unknowns, partial familiarity    | Estimate with wide range (3x spread)  |
| 4+ unknowns, new technology          | Spike first (1-2 days), then estimate |
| "I have no idea"                     | Definitely spike first                |

A spike is a timeboxed investigation to reduce uncertainty. The output is information
(and a narrower estimate), not code.
