### Score Calculation Verification

**Arithmetic breakdown** (required for audit trail):

```text
Structural Integrity:   {{X}} × 0.20 = {{result}}
Scalability:           {{X}} × 0.18 = {{result}}
Security:              {{X}} × 0.18 = {{result}}
Performance:           {{X}} × 0.17 = {{result}}
Enterprise Readiness:  {{X}} × 0.15 = {{result}}
Operational Excellence: {{X}} × 0.07 = {{result}}
Data Architecture:     {{X}} × 0.05 = {{result}}
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Weighted Sum:                        {{SUM}}
Overall Percentage: {{SUM}} / 5 × 100 = {{SCORE}}%
Grade: {{GRADE}} (per {{RANGE}} range)
```

**Verification checklist:**

- [ ] Weights sum to 100%: 20 + 18 + 18 + 17 + 15 + 7 + 5 = 100 ✓
- [ ] Each weighted value = score × weight (3 decimal precision)
- [ ] Weighted sum = sum of all weighted values
- [ ] Percentage = weighted sum / 5 × 100
- [ ] Grade matches percentage per rubric: A(90-100), B(80-89), C(70-79), D(60-69), F(<60)

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Multi-Dimension Issues

{{Issues that span multiple dimensions. Reference the relevant dimensions.}}

### Conflicting Design Decisions

{{Contradictions in the architecture. E.g., claiming strong consistency alongside horizontal
scalability without addressing the inherent tension.}}

### Architectural Coherence Assessment

{{Does this architecture have a unified vision? Or is it an accidental architecture assembled
from disconnected decisions?}}

### Requirements Alignment

{{Does this architecture solve the stated problem at the stated scale? Is it over-engineered
or under-engineered?}}

### Architecture Pattern Fitness

{{Is the current/proposed architecture pattern the right one? If not, what would be better
and why? Include migration path considerations if recommending a change.}}

{{Include a Mermaid diagram here if it helps illustrate the architectural concern — e.g.,
a dependency graph showing circular dependencies, a data flow showing a bottleneck, or a
proposed improved architecture.}}

### Systemic Risk

{{The single biggest risk. If one thing will sink this system, what is it?}}

## Appendix

### A. Files / Documents Reviewed

{{List all files, documents, and sources examined during the review.}}

### B. Assumptions Made

{{List assumptions that were made where information was incomplete.}}

### C. Out-of-Scope Items

{{Items explicitly excluded from this review and why.}}

### D. Sub-Criteria Marked Not Applicable

{{List sub-criteria skipped with justification for each.}}

### E. Methodology

This review was conducted using the Architecture Reviewer framework, evaluating 7 dimensions
with weighted scoring. Findings are classified by severity (S1-Critical through
S5-Informational). The overall score is computed as the weighted average of dimension scores,
normalized to a 100-point scale.

Dimension weights: Structural Integrity (20%), Scalability (18%), Security (18%),
Performance (17%), Enterprise Readiness (15%), Operational Excellence (7%),
Data Architecture (5%).

{{Note any weight adjustments made for this specific review and why.}}
