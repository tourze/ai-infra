## 1. Dimension Score Scale

| Score | Label          | General Criteria                                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | **Exemplary**  | Best-in-class. All sub-criteria met or exceeded. Could serve as a reference architecture. No S1/S2 findings. At most a few S4/S5 findings.                     |
| 4     | **Strong**     | Well-designed. Most sub-criteria met. No S1 findings. At most 1-2 S2 findings. Minor improvements possible.                                                    |
| 3     | **Adequate**   | Meets basic requirements. Several sub-criteria partially met. No S1 findings. Multiple S2/S3 findings. Notable gaps exist but system can function.             |
| 2     | **Concerning** | Significant issues. Multiple sub-criteria unmet. May have S1 findings. Many S2/S3 findings. System will encounter serious problems under realistic conditions. |
| 1     | **Critical**   | Fundamentally flawed. Most sub-criteria unmet or absent. Multiple S1 findings. Requires significant redesign before production use.                            |

### Half-Score Policy

**Half-scores (e.g., 3.5) are permitted** when a dimension falls clearly between two levels.
Use half-scores when:

- The architecture meets most criteria for the higher score but has 1-2 notable gaps
- The architecture exceeds the lower score criteria but doesn't fully meet the higher level
- Evidence supports a nuanced assessment rather than forcing into a whole number

**Do not use half-scores** to avoid making a decision. If uncertain, gather more evidence or
document the uncertainty and round down (conservative scoring).

## 3. Weight Justification

| Dimension              | Weight | Rationale                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structural Integrity   | 20%    | Foundation of everything. Bad structure affects all other dimensions. Highest blast radius for defects.                       |
| Security               | 18%    | A single security failure can be catastrophic (data breach, compliance violation). Cannot be retrofitted easily.              |
| Scalability            | 18%    | Scaling failures are expensive to fix after the fact. Architectural decisions constrain scaling options.                      |
| Performance            | 17%    | Directly impacts user experience and cost. Many performance issues are architectural, not just code-level.                    |
| Enterprise Readiness   | 15%    | Critical for B2B/enterprise but less universally applicable. Weight adjusts based on stated requirements.                     |
| Operational Excellence | 7%     | Important but lower blast radius. Operational gaps cause pain but rarely catastrophic failure. Can be improved incrementally. |
| Data Architecture      | 5%     | Critical when wrong but narrower in scope. Often a subset of structural integrity concerns.                                   |

**Dynamic weight adjustment:** If the system is purely internal tooling with no enterprise
customers, reduce Enterprise Readiness weight and redistribute to other dimensions. Document
any weight adjustments in the report.

## 4. Overall Score Calculation

### Formula

```text
Overall Score (%) = Σ(dimension_score × weight) / 5 × 100
```

### Calculation Steps (MUST follow in report)

1. **Calculate each weighted contribution:**

   ```
   weighted_contribution = dimension_score × weight
   ```

2. **Sum all weighted contributions:**

   ```
   weighted_sum = Σ(weighted_contribution)
   ```

3. **Convert to percentage:**

   ```
   overall_percentage = weighted_sum / 5 × 100
   ```

4. **Assign grade** based on percentage (see Grade Boundaries below)

| Enterprise Readiness   | 2     | 15%      | 2 × 0.15    | 0.300     |
| Operational Excellence | 3     | 7%       | 3 × 0.07    | 0.210     |
| Data Architecture      | 3     | 5%       | 3 × 0.05    | 0.150     |
| **Total**              |       | **100%** |             | **3.220** |

```text
Overall = 3.220 / 5 × 100 = 64.4%
Grade: D (60-69 range)
```

### Arithmetic Verification (REQUIRED)

Before finalizing the report, verify the calculation:

1. **Check weights sum to 100%:** 20 + 18 + 18 + 17 + 15 + 7 + 5 = 100% ✓
2. **Recalculate weighted sum:** Multiply each score × weight, sum results
3. **Verify grade matches range:** Cross-reference percentage with Grade Boundaries table
4. **Sanity check:** If all scores are 3, weighted sum = 3.0, percentage = 60% (D grade)
   If all scores are 4, weighted sum = 4.0, percentage = 80% (B grade)

**Common errors to avoid:**

- Rounding individual weighted contributions before summing (keep 3 decimal places)
- Using wrong weights (check for weight adjustments documented in report)
- Misreading the grade boundary (70-79 is C, not 60-69)

## 5. Grade Boundaries

| Range  | Grade | Interpretation                     | Recommended Action                                              |
| ------ | ----- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 90-100 | **A** | Production-ready, enterprise-grade | Maintain and iterate                                            |
| 80-89  | **B** | Solid architecture                 | Address S2 findings before scaling                              |
| 70-79  | **C** | Acceptable with improvement needed | Prioritize S1/S2 findings, create improvement roadmap           |
| 60-69  | **D** | Major rework required              | Address S1 findings immediately, significant refactoring needed |
| <60    | **F** | Fundamental redesign recommended   | Consider architecture reset for most problematic dimensions     |

## 6. Calibration Rules

### Stage-Based Expectations

| Stage             | Expected Minimum Grade | Scoring Adjustments                                                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Greenfield Design | C+                     | Don't penalize for missing implementation. Score the plan, not the code.        |
| Early Development | C                      | Expect foundations to be right. Operational gaps acceptable.                    |
| Growth            | B-                     | Most dimensions should be addressed. Operational excellence becoming important. |
| Mature Production | B+                     | All dimensions should be strong. S1/S2 findings are serious at this stage.      |

### Scale-Based Expectations

| Scale                   | Enterprise Readiness Expectation        | Operational Excellence Expectation |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Solo dev / side project | Basic auth and deployment sufficient    | CI and basic logging sufficient    |
| Small team (2-5)        | Standard auth, basic monitoring         | CI/CD, centralized logging         |
| Multiple teams (5-20)   | RBAC, audit logging, staged deployments | Full CI/CD, metrics, alerting      |
| Org-wide (20+)          | Full enterprise readiness expected      | Full operational maturity expected |

### Scoring Integrity Rules

1. **Never score N/A as zero.** If a sub-criterion is genuinely not applicable, exclude it
   from the dimension score calculation.
2. **Never inflate scores to be nice.** A 3 that should be a 2 helps no one.
3. **Ground every score in evidence.** "This feels like a 4" is not acceptable. Cite specific
   findings.
4. **Score the architecture, not the team.** Don't give a higher score because the team is
   talented. Score what's in front of you.
5. **Consistency check:** A dimension with multiple S2 findings cannot score above 3. A
   dimension with any S1 finding cannot score above 2.
6. **Minimum one strength per dimension.** Every dimension must have at least one positive
   finding (S5 strength) unless the dimension is truly catastrophic (score 1). Architecture
   reviews that are 100% negative are demoralizing and miss genuine strengths.
7. **Verify arithmetic before finalizing.** Recalculate the weighted sum and percentage
   independently. Grade must match the calculated percentage per Grade Boundaries table.
